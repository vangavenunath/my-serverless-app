## TODO

My first attempt with serverless framework. I enjoyed working with it.
Below are few pending things.

- Unit test coverage 100%
- Cleanup types
- Integration and performance tests
- IAM roles custom if required.
- Post a message on board only if board exists
- Request body/path parameters validation
- Remove debug statements

## Deploy

### To Test It Locally

* Run ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies.
* Run ```npm run local``` use serverless offline to test locally. 

### Deploy on AWS, simply run:

```
$ npm run deploy

```
